## Local Development

### This method will use your local machine to contribute to the project. This will require you to download multiple programs onto your computer. This is the method most programmers use when working on projects. 

### Required Downloads & Tools

- Terminal (Mac OS) or Command Prompt. These are installed by default on your computer. Search for the program to open it. **For Windows, [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) is recommended.**
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - This is a version control tool. For Windows, this download will include Git Bash.
- A text editor such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), etc.

### Local Development Instructions

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojipages/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Add+Book%22) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojipages/pulls) to see if the book you would like to add is listed. If it is not listed as an Issue or Pull Request, continue to the next step. If it is listed as an Issue or Pull Request already, please choose something else to add. 
2. Fork this repository. This will create a copy of the repository and create a new repository on your account.
3. Once the repo is forked, you will be taken to the forked repo. Note: In the top left, the name of the repo should now include your username.
4. Download the project to your computer. Click on the `Clone or Download` button. Copy the HTTPS github repo link.
5. In your terminal, navigate to where you would like to save the project (such as `cd Desktop`). Run the following command in the terminal, replacing the following link with your copied link: `git clone https://github.com/your-username-will-be-here/emojipages.git`;
6. After the command has been run, in the terminal, navigate into the EmojiPages project folder: `cd emojipages`.
7. Open the `emojipages` project in your text editor of choice. Edit the `data.js` file and add a new object for your book or play in alphabetical order. Make sure there is a comma between your object and the objects above and below. Refer to [the card overview section](/card_overview.md) for requirements for the different object keys.  Make sure to save your file after you have made changes. 

Use the following object as a template:

```
{
  title: "Matilda",
  author: "Roald Dahl",
  emojiImgs: "üë©‚Äçüè´üìöüëßü¶éüéÇ‚ú®",
  genres: ["children","fantasy"],
  year: 1988,
  itemLink: "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39988.Matilda"
}
```

8. If you would like to see what your addition will look like, open the `index.html` file that is in the `emojipages` folder in a web browser. The `EmojiCards` are added in a random order so it may take you a few seconds to find what you added. If you do not see any cards in the browser, this could mean that you have a typo in your `data.js` file. If that is the case, double check what you have added for missing commas and quotation marks.
9. Once you are done, go to the terminal and type `git status`. You should see `data.js` as modified. If you don't see this, go back and make sure to save your `data.js` file.
10. Run `git add -A` to add your changes.
11. Add a commit message. Run the following command and replace with your book name: `git commit -m "Added 1984 by George Orwell"`.
12. If you have never used git on your computer before, you will see a message asking for you to set your email and username. If you do not see that message, continue to the next step. Run the following commands, replacing "you@example.com" with your Github email and "Your name" with your github username:

`git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

Then re-run the commit command. Remember to replace with your book or play: `git commit -m "Added 1984 by George Orwell"`

13. Run `git push`. If you have not done this before, git push will not run until you login to your Github account. Type in your Github username and password. **NOTE: When you type your password, it will not show in the terminal. Press enter after you type your password to continue**.

14. Go to the Github website and navigate to the `Pull Request` tab. Click on New `Pull Request`.

15. Review your changes and then click `Create Pull Request`. Add any additional comments, go through the checklist within the Pull Request and add an Issue number if applicable, then click on `Create Pull Request`.
16. Wait for feedback/review of your Pull Request. Your code will be reviewed and if any changes need to be made, we will let you know. Once your pull request is accepted, you will be able to see your card at [https://emojipages.com](https://emojipages.com) and you will officially have contributed to the project! üéâ
